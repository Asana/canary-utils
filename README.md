# Thinkst Canary Scripts
A hodgepodge of humble but helpful scripts created for Thinkst Canary customers.

While it's great that most products and services these days have APIs, they're often oversold. The answer to any question about a missing feature can be, "you can do anything with our product, it has an API!"

Logically, your next thought might be, "sure, but that API would be a lot more useful if I had a few spare Python developers to throw at a few projects..."

In this spirit, we often build scripts and bits of code to help customers automate and integrate things withour API. In some cases, our fantastic customers even write the code and donate it back to us! In general, most of these scripts will need to be edited to add your Canary Console URL (in the form of ab1234ef.canary.tools) and your API key, which can be found in the Canary Console settings.

Happy birding!
